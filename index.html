        <h2>Characters</h2>

        <p>
            The Harry Potter series follows the journey of Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers the 
            magical world after being raised amoung non-magical people. Upon entering Hogwarts School of
            Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry forms close friendship with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
            Together, they support each other through academic challenges, personal conflicts, and dangerous
            situations, showing the importance of loyalty, trust, and cooperation.

            Throughout his education, Harry is guided by several influential teachers. Albus Dumbledore, 
            the headmaster of Hogwarts, represents wisdom, leadership, and moral guidance. Minerva McGonagall
            emphasizes discipline and fairness, while Severus Snape plays a complex role, appearing strict and
            hostile but later revealed to have deeper motivations. Other teachers contribute knowledge,
            structure, and protection within the school environment.
        </p>

            Harry also faces strong opposition from rivals and enemies. Draco Malfoy serves as a school
            rival who reflects themes of prejudice and arrogance, while Lord Voldemort represents the primary
            antagonist and a symbol of fear, power, and abuse of magic. The conflict between Harry and Voldemort
            highlights the contrast between choices driven by selfish ambition and those guided by courage and sacrifice.

            The interactions between friends, teachers, and enemies shape the central themes of the story:
            the struggle between good and evil, the significance of personal choice, and the process of growing 
            up under difficult circumstances. Rather than focusing solely on magical abilities, the narrative 
            emphasizes character development and the value of standing up for what is right, even when faced with great risk.
